    <h1>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
    <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
    <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It is standardized across web browsers and is widely used to create visually engaging web pages.</p>
